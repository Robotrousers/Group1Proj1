## How to Make The Most Money$ with One Movie

### Introduction

We are representatives of a small indie film company, Mo Money$ Movie$. Our shared love for movies and making money has brought us together. Our focus is to determine how to maximize profits from a single movie to grow our company and continue our filming journey. In order to do this, we are using OMDb and IMDb API and databases to analyze movie budgets, profits, and ratings.

### Project Scope  
We will be analyzing movies between the years of 2005-2015. This decade was chosen to take into consideration the rise of streaming platforms and avoid COVID-related data. We do not discriminate against any production company that will give us money!

### Key Metrics
We will analyze:
- Total movie budget
- Total movie profit
- Movie genre
- Total ratings
- Critic vs general audience ratings

### Movie Selection Criteria
In addition to years, our movies will also be limited to the top 50 movies of each year. The “top” movies will be determined using number of ratings in order to avoid including movies which have only two 100% votes. By utilizing this method of number of votes, we believe we will be pulling the most watched and therefore most paid-for movies.
